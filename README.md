# Repertory

A multi-user video streaming application with many UX-friendly features.

## How to develop

To start, you will need to clone this repository. The backend and the frontend are separate entities and are self-contained, so you will need to execute `yarn install` or `npm install` for each of them.

To run a frontend dev server /w webpack and hot-reloading, by default at port `3000`:
```
yarn run start
```

To run a backend server with nodemon and ts-node, by default at port `3001`:
```
yarn run dev
```
Both commands have to be executed in their specific folders.
